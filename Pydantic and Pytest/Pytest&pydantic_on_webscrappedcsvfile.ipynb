      "  Value error, 'In this section, we explain what alternative investments are and why assets under management in alternative investments have grown in recent decades. We also explain how alternative investments differ from traditional investments, and we examine their perceived investment merit. We conclude this section with a brief overview of the various categories of alternative investments; these categories will be explored further in later sections.Alternative investments is a label for a disparate group of investments that are distinguished from long-only, publicly traded investments in stocks, bonds, and cash (often referred to as traditional investments). The terms traditional and alternative should not imply that alternatives are necessarily uncommon or that they are relatively recent additions to the investment universe. Alternative investments include such assets as real estate and commodities, which are arguably two of the oldest types of investments.Alternative investments also include non-traditional approaches to investing within special vehicles, such as private equity funds and hedge funds. These funds may give the manager flexibility to use derivatives and leverage, to make investments in illiquid assets, and to take short positions. The assets in which these vehicles invest can include traditional assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) as well as less traditional assets. Management of alternative investments is typically active. Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics:Narrow specialization of the investment managersRelatively low correlation of returns with those of traditional investmentsLess regulation and less transparency than traditional investmentsLimited historical risk and return dataUnique legal and tax considerationsHigher fees, often including performance or incentive feesConcentrated portfoliosRestrictions on redemptions (i.e., lockups and gates)' must end with a full stop.

      "Summary\n",
      "  Value error, 'We have discussed the use of residual income models in valuation. Residual income is an appealing economic concept because it attempts to measure economic profit, which are profits after accounting for all opportunity costs of capital. Residual income is calculated as net income minus a deduction for the cost of equity capital. The deduction, called the equity charge, is equal to equity capital multiplied by the required rate of return on equity (the cost of equity capital in percent). Economic value added (EVA) is a commercial implementation of the residual income concept. EVA = NOPAT  (C%  TC), where NOPAT is net operating profit after taxes, C% is the percent cost of capital, and TC is total capital. Residual income models (including commercial implementations) are used not only for equity valuation but also to measure internal corporate performance and for determining executive compensation. We can forecast per-share residual income as forecasted earnings per share minus the required rate of return on equity multiplied by beginning book value per share. Alternatively, per-share residual income can be forecasted as beginning book value per share multiplied by the difference between forecasted ROE and the required rate of return on equity. In the residual income model, the intrinsic value of a share of common stock is the sum of book value per share and the present value of expected future per-share residual income. In the residual income model, the equivalent mathematical expressions for intrinsic value of a common stock are V 0 = B 0 + t = 1 RI t ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + t = 1 E t r B t 1 ( 1 + r ) t = B 0 + t = 1 ( ROE t r ) B t 1 ( 1 + r ) t where V 0 = value of a share of stock today (t = 0) B 0 = current per-share book value of equity Bt = expected per-share book value of equity at any time t r = required rate of return on equity (cost of equity) Et = expected earnings per share for period t RI t = expected per-share residual income, equal to Et rBt 1 or to (ROE  r)  Bt 1 ROET = return on equity In the two-stage model with continuing residual income in stage two, the intrinsic value of a share of stock is V 0 = B 0 + t = 1 T RI t ( 1 + r ) t + P T B T ( 1 + r ) T = B 0 + t = 1 T ( E t r B t 1 ) ( 1 + r ) t + P T B T ( 1 + r ) T V 0 = B 0 + t = 1 T ( ROE t r ) B t 1 ( 1 + r ) t + P T B T ( 1 + r ) T where PT = expected per share price at terminal time T BT = expected per share book value at terminal time T' must end with a full stop.

Rather than try to apply every possible technique and tool to every situation, it is essential for the investor to consider and identify the proper type of analysis to apply in a given situation.The primary reason for performing financial analysis is to help in making an economic decision. Before making such decisions as whether to lend to a particular long-term borrower or to invest a large sum in a common stock, venture capital vehicle, or private equity candidate, an investor or financial decision-maker wants to make sure that the probability of a successful outcome is on his or her side. Rather than leave outcomes to chance, a financial decision-maker should use financial analysis to identify and make more visible potential favorable and unfavorable outcomes.The purpose of this reading is to provide examples of the effective use of financial analysis in decision making.

Business risk is the risk associated with operating earnings and reflects both sales risk (uncertainty with respect to the price and quantity of sales) and operating risk (the risk related to the use of fixed costs in operations). Financial risk is the risk associated with how a company finances its operations (i.e., the split between equity and debt financing of the business).  The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is the ratio of the percentage change in operating income to the percentage change in units sold. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of operating leverage:  DOL=Q(PV)Q(PV)F The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is the percentage change in net income for a one percent change in operating income. We can use the following formula to measure the degree of financial leverage:  DFL=[Q(PV)F](1t)[Q(PV)FC](1t)=[Q(PV)F][Q(PV)FC] The degree of total leverage (DTL) is a measure of the sensitivity of net income to changes in unit sales, which is equivalent to DTL = DOL  DFL.

If used incorrectly, however, multiple linear regression may yield spurious relationships, lead to poor predictions, and offer a poor understanding of relationships.The analyst must first specify the model and make several decisions in this process. The analyst must answer the following questions: What is the dependent variable of interest? What independent variables are important? What form should the model take? What is the goal of the modelprediction or understanding of the relationship?The analyst specifies the dependent and independent variables and then employs software to estimate the model and produce related statistics.

Macroeconomics focuses on national aggregates, such as totalinvestment, the amount spent by all businesses on plant and equipment; totalconsumption, the amount spent by all households on goods and services; the rate of change in the general level of prices; and the overall level of interest rates.Macroeconomic analysis examines a nations aggregate output and income, its competitive and comparative advantages, the productivity of its labor force, its price level and inflation rate, and the actions of its national government and central bank. The objective of macroeconomic analysis is to address such fundamental questions as:What is an economys aggregate output, and how is aggregate income measured?What factors determine the level of aggregate output/income for an economy?What are the levels of aggregate demand and aggregate supply of goods and services within the country?Is the level of output increasing or decreasing, and at what rate?Is the general price level stable, rising, or falling?Is unemployment rising or falling?Are households spending or saving more?Are workers able to produce more output for a given level of inputs?Are businesses investing in and expanding their productive capacity?Are exports (imports) rising or falling?From an investment perspective, investors must be able to evaluate a countrys current economic environment and to forecast its future economic environment in order to identify asset classes and securities that will benefit from economic trends occurring within that country.

      "  Value error, 'This reading provided an overview of DCF models of valuation, discussed the estimation of a stocks required rate of return, and presented in detail the dividend discount model. In DCF models, the value of any asset is the present value of its (expected) future cash flows V0=t=1nCFt(1+r)t where V0 is the value of the asset as of t = 0 (today), CFt is the (expected) cash flow at time t, and r is the discount rate or required rate of return. For infinitely lived assets such as common stocks, n runs to infinity. Several alternative streams of expected cash flows can be used to value equities, including dividends, free cash flow, and residual income. A discounted dividend approach is most suitable for dividend-paying stocks in which the company has a discernible dividend policy that has an understandable relationship to the companys profitability, and the investor has a noncontrol (minority ownership) perspective. The free cash flow approach (FCFF or FCFE) might be appropriate when the company does not pay dividends, dividends differ substantially from FCFE, free cash flows align with profitability, or the investor takes a control (majority ownership) perspective. The residual income approach can be useful when the company does not pay dividends (as an alternative to a FCF approach) or free cash flow is negative. The DDM with a single holding period gives stock value as V0=D1(1+r)1+P1(1+r)1=D1 +P1(1+r)1 where D 1 is the expected dividend at time 1 and V0 is the stocks (expected) value at time 0. Assuming that V0 is equal to todays market price, P 0, the expected holding-period return is r=D1+P1P01=D1P0+P1P0P0 The expression for the DDM for any given finite holding period n and the gen - eral expression for the DDM are, respectively, V0=t=1nDt(1+r)t+Pn(1+r)n and V0=t=1Dt(1+r)t There are two main approaches to the problem of forecasting dividends. First, an analyst can assign the entire stream of expected future dividends to one of several stylized growth patterns. Second, an analyst can forecast a finite number of dividends individually up to a terminal point and value the remaining divi - dends either by assigning them to a stylized growth pattern or by forecasting share price as of the terminal point of the dividend forecasts. The Gordon growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant rate g for - ever, so that D t = Dt 1(1 + g). The dividend stream in the Gordon growth model has a value of V0=D0(1+g)rg, or V0=D1rg where r>g The value of noncallable fixed-rate perpetual preferred stock is V0 = D / r, where D is the stocks (constant) annual dividend. Assuming that price equals value, the Gordon growth model estimate of a stocks expected rate of return is r=D0(1+g)P0+g=D1P0+g Given an estimate of the next-period dividend and the stocks required rate of return, the Gordon growth model can be used to estimate the dividend growth rate implied by the current market price (making a constant growth rate assumption). The present value of growth opportunities (PVGO) is the part of a stocks total value, V0, that comes from profitable future growth opportunities in contrast to the value associated with assets already in place. The relationship is V0 = E 1 / r + PVGO, where E 1 / r is defined as the no-growth value per share. The leading price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 1) and the trailing price-to-earnings ratio ( P 0 / E 0) can be expressed in terms of the Gordon growth model as, respectively, P0E1=D1/E1rg=1b rg and P0E0=D0(1+g)/E0rg=(1b)(1+g)rg The above expressions give a stocks justified price-to-earnings ratio based on forecasts of fundamentals (given that the Gordon growth model is appropriate). The Gordon growth model may be useful for valuing broad-based equity indexes and the stock of businesses with earnings that are expected to grow at a stable rate comparable to or lower than the nominal growth rate of the economy. Gordon growth model values are very sensitive to the assumed growth rate and required rate of return. For many companies, growth falls into phases. In the growth phase, a company enjoys an abnormally high growth rate in earnings per share, called super - normal growth. In the transition phase, earnings growth slows. In the mature phase, the company reaches an equilibrium in which such factors as earnings growth and the return on equity stabilize at levels that can be sustained long term. Analysts often apply multistage DCF models to value the stock of a company with multistage growth prospects. The two-stage dividend discount model assumes different growth rates in Stage 1 and Stage 2  V0=t=1nD0(1+gS)t(1+r)t+D0(1+gS)n(1+gL) (1+r)n(rgL)   where gS is the expected dividend growth rate in the first period and gL is the expected growth rate in the second period. The terminal stock value, Vn, is sometimes found with the Gordon growth model or with some other method, such as applying a P/E multiplier to forecasted EPS as of the terminal date. The H-model assumes that the dividend growth rate declines linearly from a high supernormal rate to the normal growth rate during Stage 1, and then grows at a constant normal growth rate thereafter: V0=D0(1+gL)rgL+D0H(gSgL)rgL=D0(1+gL)+D0H(gSgL)rgL There are two basic three-stage models. In one version, the growth rate in the middle stage is constant. In the second version, the growth rate declines linearly in Stage 2 and becomes constant and normal in Stage 3. Spreadsheet models are very flexible, providing the analyst with the ability to value any pattern of expected dividends. In addition to valuing equities, the IRR of a DDM, assuming assets are correctly priced in the marketplace, has been used to estimate required returns. For simpler models (such as the one-period model, the Gordon growth model, and the H-model), well-known formulas may be used to calculate these rates of return. For many dividend streams, however, the rate of return must be found by trial and error, producing a discount rate that equates the present value of the forecasted dividend stream to the current market price. Multistage DDM models can accommodate a wide variety of patterns of expected dividends. Even though such models may use stylized assumptions about growth, they can provide useful approximations. Dividend growth rates can be obtained from analyst forecasts, statistical forecasting models, or company fundamentals. The sustainable growth rate depends on the ROE and the earnings retention rate, b: g = b  ROE.

      "  Value error, 'Alternative investments is a label applied to a disparate group of investments to distinguish them from traditional investmentsthat is, investments in long-only, publicly traded investments in stocks, bonds, and cash. We can think about three major categories of alternative investments based on how they differ from traditional investments:private capitalreal assetshedge fundsOne of the key features of alternative investments is that investing in them requires special skills and information. Investing in alternative assets can require handling illiquidity, transacting on private markets, operating sophisticated investment strategies, or riskreturn profiles that are different from those of traditional long-only investments.Why Investors Consider Alternative InvestmentsAlternative investments offer a variety of advantages:broader diversification through accessing a larger universe of investments or because of their lower correlation with traditional asset classes;opportunities for enhanced returns by improving the portfolios riskreturn profile; andpotentially increased returns through higher yields, particularly compared with traditional investments in lowinterest rate periods.The 2019 annual report for the Yale University endowment provides one institutional investors reasoning for investing in alternatives:The heavy [75.2%] allocation to nontraditional asset classes stems from the diversifying power they provide to the portfolio as a whole. Alternative assets, by their very nature, tend to be less efficiently priced than traditional marketable securities, providing an opportunity to exploit market inefficiencies through active management. Todays portfolio has significantly higher expected returns and lower volatility than the 1989 portfolio.This quote neatly illustrates the expected characteristics of alternative investments: diversifying power, higher expected returns, and illiquid and potentially less efficient markets. The quote also highlights the importance of having the willingness and the ability to take a long-term perspective. Endowments, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and even family offices allocate increasing portions of their portfolios to alternative investments seeking to benefit from diversification and return opportunities.Alternative investments are not free of risk, of course, and their returns may be correlated with those of other investments, especially in periods of financial crisis. Over a long historical period, the average correlation of returns from alternative investments with those of traditional investments may be low, but in any particular period, the correlation can differ from the average. During periods of economic crisis, correlations among many assets (both alternative and traditional) can increase dramatically.Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics:narrow specialization of the investment managers,relatively low correlation of returns with those of traditional investments, andless regulation and less transparency than traditional investments.As a result of these characteristics, alternative investments often exhibit the following:limited reliable historical risk and return data;unique legal and tax considerations;higher fees, often including performance or incentive fees;concentrated portfolios; andrestrictions on redemptions (i.e., lockups and gates).Categories of Alternative InvestmentsConsidering the variety of alternative investments, it is not surprising that consensus has not been reached on a definitive list of groups or categories. Considerable debate even surrounds the use of categories versus subcategories.
